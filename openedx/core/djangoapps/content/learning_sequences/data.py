"""
Public data structures for this app.

Guidelines:

1. Make these data structures immutable (frozen=True) wherever possible, as it
   simplifies debugging.
2. This module should not import any other part of the app. This is the module
   that everything else imports, not the other way around. Dependencies should
   be kept to an absolute minimumâ€“the Python stdlib, attr, opaque keys, and some
   Django primitives.
3. Keep the data classes dumb. Business logic should go into the api package
   modules that operate on this data. Do not attach complex objects with methods
   as attributes to data classes, as this makes them more difficult to mock out
   and make guarantees about behavior.
4. These data classes can perform validation, but only if that validation is
   entirely self-contained. They MUST NOT make database calls, network requests,
   or use API functions from other apps. They should not trigger expensive
   computation.

Note: we're using old-style syntax for attrs because we need to support Python
3.5, but we can move to the PEP-526 style once we move to Python 3.6+.
