These directories specify the Python (and system) dependencies for the LMS and Studio.

- ``edx`` contains the normal Python requirements files
- ``edx-sandbox`` contains the requirements files for Codejail
- ``constraints.txt`` is shared between the two

(In a normal `OEP-18`_-compliant repository, the ``*.in`` and ``*.txt`` files would be
directly in the requirements directory.)
